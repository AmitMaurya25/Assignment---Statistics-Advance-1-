# Question -1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. 
In simpler terms, the PDF gives the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value or falling within a certain range of values.

The PDF is an essential concept in statistics as it allows us to understand the behavior and characteristics of continuous random variables, such as height, weight, temperature, etc.
It helps in calculating probabilities of events and making inferences based on observed data.

# Question -2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

There are several types of probability distributions in statistics. Each type is associated with specific characteristics and is used to model different types of random variables. 
The two main categories of probability distributions are:

1- Discrete Probability Distributions:
    Discrete probability distributions are used to model random variables that take on a finite or countable number of distinct values.
    The probability mass function (PMF) is used to describe the probabilities of each possible outcome.

2- Continuous Probability Distributions:
    Continuous probability distributions are used to model random variables that can take on any value within a specific range.
    The probability density function (PDF) is used to describe the probabilities of different intervals of values.
# Question -3 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>


To calculate the probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution at a given point, you can use the formula for the PDF of a normal distribution:

PDF(x) = (1 / (σ * √(2π))) * exp(-((x - μ)^2 / (2 * σ^2)))

where:

x is the point at which you want to calculate the PDF.
μ is the mean (average) of the normal distribution.
σ is the standard deviation of the normal distribution.
You can implement this formula in a Python function as follows:


        import math
        
        def normal_pdf(x, mean, std_dev):
            if std_dev <= 0:
                raise ValueError("Standard deviation must be positive.")
            
            coefficient = 1 / (std_dev * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
            exponent = -((x - mean) ** 2) / (2 * std_dev ** 2)
            
            pdf_value = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
            return pdf_value
        
        # Example usage:
        mean = 0
        std_dev = 1
        point = 1.5
        pdf_at_point = normal_pdf(point, mean, std_dev)
        print(f"PDF at point {point} is: {pdf_at_point}")
In this function, we first check if the standard deviation is positive, as it must be. Then, we calculate the coefficient and exponent using the given mean and standard deviation.
Finally, we compute the PDF value at the given point x and return it.

You can use this function with different mean and standard deviation values to calculate the PDF at various points within the normal distribution.

# Question -4 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

The properties of the Binomial distribution are as follows:

1. Fixed number of trials: The Binomial distribution is defined for a fixed number of trials, denoted as "n", where each trial is independent of the others.
2: Two outcomes: Each trial has only two possible outcomes, typically labeled as "success" and "failure".
3: Independent trials: The outcome of each trial does not affect the outcome of other trials; they are independent of each other.
4- Constant probability: The probability of success (p) remains constant across all trials.
5- Discrete distribution: The Binomial distribution is discrete since it deals with whole numbers (non-negative integers).

Examples of events where the Binomial distribution can be applied:

Coin flipping: Consider flipping a fair coin multiple times. Each flip has two possible outcomes: "heads" (success) with probability 0.5 and "tails" (failure) with probability 0.5.
The number of heads obtained in a fixed number of coin flips (n) follows a Binomial distribution.

Quality control: In a manufacturing process, a machine produces defective items with a certain probability (p) and non-defective items with probability (q = 1 - p).
If we inspect a fixed number of items (n) from the production line, the number of defective items among them follows a Binomial distribution.


# Question -5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

To generate a random sample of size 1000 from a binomial distribution with a probability of success of 0.4 and plot a histogram of the results,
you can use the `numpy` library to generate the random sample and `matplotlib` to create the histogram. First, make sure you have both libraries installed. 
You can install them using `pip` if you haven't already:


    pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Now, you can use the following Python code to generate the sample and plot the histogram:


    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    def generate_binomial_sample(size, probability):
        return np.random.binomial(1, probability, size=size)
    
    sample_size = 1000
    success_probability = 0.4

# Generate the random sample
    sample = generate_binomial_sample(sample_size, success_probability)

# Plot the histogram
    plt.hist(sample, bins=2, alpha=0.6, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
    plt.xticks([0, 1], ['Failure', 'Success'])
    plt.xlabel('Outcome')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title(f'Binomial Distribution Histogram (n=1000, p=0.4)')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```


# Question -6 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>


To calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a Poisson distribution at a given point, you can use the formula for the CDF of a Poisson distribution:

CDF(x) = Σ(λ^k * exp(-λ) / k!) for k = 0 to x

where:

1- CDF(x) is the cumulative probability of the Poisson random variable being less than or equal to "x".
2- λ (lambda) is the mean of the Poisson distribution.
3- Σ represents the sum from 0 to x, where "x" is the point at which you want to calculate the CDF.
4- k is the number of events (non-negative integer) for which the probability is being calculated.
5- exp() is the exponential function.
Now, let's implement this formula in a Python function:


    import math
    
    def poisson_cdf(x, mean):
        if x < 0 or mean <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Both x and mean must be non-negative.")
        
        cdf_value = 0.0
        term = 1.0
        for k in range(x + 1):
            cdf_value += term
            term *= (mean / (k + 1))
        
        return 1 - math.exp(-mean) * cdf_value
    
    # Example usage:
    mean = 2.5
    point = 4
    cdf_at_point = poisson_cdf(point, mean)
    print(f"CDF at point {point} is: {cdf_at_point}")

# Question -7 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

The Binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution are two different probability distributions used to model different types of events.
Here are the key differences between them:

1- Nature of Events:

    A- Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, 
        where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure. The probability of success (p) remains constant across all trials.
    B- Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space when the events are rare and random.
        The probability of an event occurring in a small subinterval is proportional to the size of the subinterval.

2- Number of Trials/Events:

    A- Binomial Distribution: The Binomial distribution deals with a fixed number of trials (n) or events, and each trial is independent of the others.
    B- Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution deals with an infinite number of trials or events, where each trial represents a small subinterval of time or space.
# Question 8---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

To generate a random sample of size 1000 from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 5 and calculate the sample mean and variance, you can use the numpy library,
which provides functions to generate random numbers from various probability distributions. First, make sure you have numpy installed:


    pip install numpy
Now, you can use the following Python code to generate the sample and calculate the sample mean and variance:



    import numpy as np
    
    def generate_poisson_sample(size, mean):
        return np.random.poisson(mean, size=size)
    
    sample_size = 1000
    mean = 5
    
    # Generate the random sample
    sample = generate_poisson_sample(sample_size, mean)
    
    # Calculate the sample mean and variance
    sample_mean = np.mean(sample)
    sample_variance = np.var(sample, ddof=1)
    
    print(f"Sample Mean: {sample_mean}")
    print(f"Sample Variance: {sample_variance}")
# Question -9 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

Mean and variance are important statistical measures that describe the spread and central tendency of a probability distribution. In both the Binomial and Poisson distributions, the relationship between mean (μ) and variance (σ^2) is different.

1- Binomial Distribution:
    The Binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has the same probability of success (p)
    and failure (q = 1 - p). If X follows a Binomial distribution with parameters n (number of trials) and p (probability of success in each trial),
    then the mean (μ) and variance (σ^2) are given by:
    Mean (μ) = n * p
    Variance (σ^2) = n * p * q
    
    The relationship between mean and variance in the Binomial distribution is straightforward.
    The variance is directly proportional to the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p),
    while the mean is equal to the product of the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p).

2- Poisson Distribution:
    The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space when the events are rare and independent. 
    If X follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ (lambda), which represents the average rate of occurrence of events in the given interval,
    then the mean (μ) and variance (σ^2) are given by:
    Mean (μ) = λ
    Variance (σ^2) = λ
    
    In the Poisson distribution, both the mean and the variance are equal to the parameter λ. Unlike the Binomial distribution, 
    where variance depends on the number of trials and the probability of success, in the Poisson distribution,
    the variance is solely determined by the average rate of occurrence (λ) of events.
# Question -10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

    In a normal distribution, the least frequent data points appear in the tails of the distribution, farthest away from the mean.
    The normal distribution is a symmetric bell-shaped curve, and its shape is determined by the mean and standard deviation.
